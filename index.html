        Throughout this project and unit, I have learned a lot about many things. First of all, I have learned how to think more critically and evalute things, such as code differently in my mind. In addition, I have learned many types of coding languages, such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Furthmore, I understood what these programming languages were used for, like HTML and CSS are used for website design, website development and website structure. Javascript is basically used more often for animations and stuff like that. In HTML, I have learned how to successfully upload images, how to create line breaks, many types of headings, paragrphs of text, and general structure website development. In addition, I have also learned many types of conditions in the programming language itself. CSS is basically the design of HTML, editing everything about HTML, you can make a background image, change the bacjground color, set font, font sizes, font colors, bordeer types, widths, radiuses, and much more! Javascript was more like the game development itself. It taught a lot about game fevelopment, like how to created animated sprites the follow the x and y position of the mouse, importing sprites and much more. I personally loved loops and arrays the most, such interesting pieces of code, yet are hard to understand perfectly. I also learned many other stuff in Javascript like functions. Moreover, I learned how to create cricles and rectangles. Furthermore, something that I have noticed about Javascript is that in general terms, the syntax and overall style of the programming language is ighly related to other programming languages that I have some kind of decent understanding of, such as Python, something we learned in class at the begginning of the school year and also how it shows relations towards the programming language C#. Also, in Javascript, I loved using arrays, used to store plenty of data in the code itself. I also really enjoyed creating games in response to the user's input, such has this game right here. In conclusion, I appreciate all of the amazing things I have learned throughout this unit.

        The objective of the game is drive a formula one car using two arrow keys. More specifically, using the left arrow key will make the car turn left and using the right arrow key will make the car turn right. While playng around with these keys, enemey cars will randomlu spawn and your goal is to doge them, not to crash into them. However, there is a problem. The speed of the car automatically goes every few moments, making it harder and harder to move left and right to dodge, the maximum speed is 9 and it will simply be seen one the right. If you do crash into one of the yellow or enemy cars, it is game over. In order to play again, simply refresh the page or website. Good luck; you probably will need it! Overall, I appreciate all of the things I have learned in this unit.

        The object of the game is to doge enemy cars randomly spawning with the formula one car. Its driver needs endure and avoid a crash as long as possible, or else; there is a high chance he might get fired! The super car itself is red (it is a formula one car). Please consider reading the Game Rules above if you have not already!
